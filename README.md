# LocalGov Live Preview

## Orientation
- Base module
- LocalGov Live Preview Microsites

### Base module
This module has a base module that does very little. It's purpose is to be available for items that can be shared across all of the sub modules, for example: theming the off-canvas tray when a live preview form is in it.

### LocalGov Live Preview Microsites
Currently, it only has one submodule: LocalGov Live Preview Microsites. This module allows you to test a live preview of your microsite, without having to save the form before you can see the changes.

### Future modules
Future plans for another submodule include a live preview feature for the main LGD CMS.

## Installing
Install this module as you would any other module.

## Configuring the module
The module has a permission for 'Use live preview'. Only users with this permission will be able to use it.

## Using Live Preview
If you have the permission 'Use live preview', you will see a new tab when viewing nodes called 'Edit Microsite Design'. Currently this tab is _only visible_ on **node** pages.

If you click on this tab, the form for editing the design of your microsite will open up in a off-canvas tray, sliding out from the right-hand side.

You can make whatever changes you like in that form and see them taking effect in the live preview. No one else will see those changes until you click the save button.
