# LocalGov Live Preview

**DO NOT USE THIS MODULE (YET)**

This is an attempt at allowing LocalGov Drupal editors to edit content with a live preview.

It is highly experimental, with the initial focus to be a proof-of-concept to allow editors to see design changes for their microsites without having to save the form and put the changes live.
